## Introduction

I will be entering the Master of Science in Data Analytics - Data Engineering (MSDADE) program at Western Governors University (WGU) in April 2025, with a background in healthcare data archival and analytics. My goal is to graduate in December 2026. 

Throughout this program, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis, learning to use tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning. This repository showcases the projects I have completed during my journey, reflecting my growth and the skills I have acquired.
