# Data Management Journey Overview

Data Management builds proficiency in using both relational and non-relational databases. Topics include selection of a data storage architecture, data types, data structures, normalization and denormalization, and querying databases. Structured Query Language (SQL) topics including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) are covered, including joins, aggregations, and transactions. Non-relational approaches to organizing and querying data are contrasted with relational approaches to build competency in adapting data storage architectures to business needs.
