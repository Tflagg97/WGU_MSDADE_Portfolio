# Analytics Programming Overview

Analytics Programming builds algorithmic thinking using both the Python and R programming languages. This course builds from the foundations of programming. Learners use libraries and packages to perform common analytics tasks, including acquiring, organizing, and manipulating datasets. The course also presents methods for applying statistical functions and graphical user interfaces to perform basic analysis and to present findings
